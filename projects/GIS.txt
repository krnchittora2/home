GNR402 PROJECT -- INDIAN RAILROADS

We took a Indian State Boundaries shapefile which was a polygon. 
The other shapefile was for Indian Railroads which was a line.

ST_Intersects():
If a geometry or geography shares any portion of space then they intersect.
This function returns true if any part of the two geometries in the parameter is shared between those geometries.
If ST_Touches, ST_Within, ST_Overlaps returns true then ST_Intersects also returns true.
In our map, this resulted in a table with 2161 rows.

ST_Within():
It is also a boolean function which takes two geometries as parameters and returns true if 1st geometry is completely within the 2nd geometry.
In our map, this resulted in a table with 1831 rows.

ST_Crosses():
This boolean function returns true if the two geometries in parameter have some but not all interior points in common.
In our map, this resulted in a table with 330 rows.

ST_Touches():
This boolean function returns true if only points common between the two geometries lie in the union of the boundaries of those geometries.
This resulted in an empty table because no railroads touches the state boundaries.
